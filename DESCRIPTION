Description: Calculates the aneuploidy score for a given tumor using the .seg
  file, as outlined by Shukla et al. Nature Comm 2020 paper 
  (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-14286-0). This method looks for gains/losses
  of a chromosome arm, adjusts it for ploidy, and calculates the aneuploidy
  score.
